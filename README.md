# ProjectEuler-davinci07
Project Euler. Like every programmer on the internet. 

This repository serves the function of containg ideas and some solutions in multiple languages of the Project Euler. Discussions within various languages and mathematics are encouraged and will be provided. Current work will mostly work original Project Euler problems. 

Understadably, sometimes it will be in question over the most optimal solutions which are related to the problems on HackerRank. Rest assured the optimized verions will only be displayed after every 25th solution produced once 50 solutions are posted. So after the 50th solution of the original problems, the first 25 optimal wil be posted.

Updates are to be weekly over several solutions varyingly based on external forces.
