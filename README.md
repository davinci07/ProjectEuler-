# ProjectEuler-davinci07
Project Euler. Like every programmer on the internet 
This repository serves the function of containg ideas and some solutions in multiple languages of the Project Euler. Discussions within various languages and mathematics are encouraged and will be provided. Current work will mostly work original Project Euler problems. 
Understadably, sometimes it will be in question over the most optimal solutions which are related to the problems on HackerRank, however, the optimized verions will only be displayed after every 25th solution produced.
